# Mini-DeepText: An Open-source Neural Text Experimental Toolkit (Current version: v2.0)

## Introduction

Mini-DeepText aims to quickly implement neural models for text classification, semantic matching, text generation and machine translation tasks. A notable feature is that Mini-DeepText currently provides a variety of NLP model training configurations, including Transformer models. You can train a variety of task models with custom hyperparameters by simply providing data and modifying the training profile.
